# Dominant Color Palette Extraction by Clustering Algorithms and Reconstruction of Image

The main goal for this project is to reduce the storage requirement and speedup the transfer time of images. The bandwidth limits the applications of multimedia in todayâ€™s world. Color quantization is important when we need to transfer a set of large images over the internet. It ramps up the efficiency and processing speed by solving storage and transmission related problems.

We have implemented three algorithms:
* K-means clustering algorithm
* Adaptive clustering algorithm
* Hierarchical Competitive learning, and evaluated them using an image set.
